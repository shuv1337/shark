/**
 * The docs prose, as data.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for everything on `/docs`. Two
 * consumers read it and neither owns any prose of its own:
 *
 * - `src/client/pages/docs/blocks.tsx` renders it as React (browser + the
 *   build-time prerender that puts the same HTML in the initial response).
 * - `src/shared/docs/markdown.ts` serialises it for `/docs.md` and `/agents.md`.
 *
 * Inline formatting inside every string is a tiny markdown subset — `` `code` ``
 * and `[text](href)` — parsed by `./inline.ts` for the React renderer and passed
 * through verbatim by the markdown serialiser. Keeping the source markdown-ish
 * means the two outputs cannot drift, and adding a section is a data edit.
 *
 * Headings are *not* stored here: they come from `./nav.ts` by id, so the
 * sidebar, the in-page headings, and the markdown outline always agree.
