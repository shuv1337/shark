# SHark v1 verification ledger

This ledger records evidence without secrets, user content, private identifiers, or unredacted
logs. Unchecked release evidence keeps the goal active.

## Source baseline

- 2026-07-27: root typecheck passed.
- 2026-07-27: contracts 24 tests, CLI 29 tests, Expo 15 tests, and website 179 tests passed
  (247 total).
- 2026-07-27: lint and production web/server build passed.
- 2026-07-27: `expo install --check` reported dependencies up to date.
- 2026-07-27: pinned `expo-doctor@1.20.1` passed all 20 checks.
- 2026-07-27: Expo public config resolved SHark name, scheme, app/widget/notification extension
  bundle IDs, and App Group without an upstream EAS project or Team ID.
- 2026-07-27: a disposable migrated SQLite database produced a verified exact-schema checkpoint
  copy through the bundled production backup command.
- 2026-07-27: workflow YAML, deployment wrapper shell syntax, and operator bundles validated.
- 2026-07-27: the recovered Devil Phone SVG and safe-area raster matched both historical SHA-256
  values; operator-controlled Git history, repository license, asset notice, and prior ownership
  confirmation established positive provenance.
- 2026-07-27: pinned Resvg generation produced byte-identical second-pass assets; the 1024px app
  icon is opaque 8-bit RGB and all generated hashes are recorded in
  `assets/brand/generated-assets.json`.
- 2026-07-27: clean native prebuild resolved only SHark external identifiers under proven operator
  Team `7H54B326YZ`; generated source entitlements contain the expected App Group, development APNs,
  Sign in with Apple, Siri, communication notification, and Live Activity configuration.
- 2026-07-27: a live built-server probe returned 200 only for `/api/health`, 401 for private
  document/static paths, and 404 for removed pricing/discovery paths. HTML document requests now
  redirect without a response body to the fixed Apple sign-in bootstrap.
- 2026-07-27: Apple App IDs exist for `dev.shuv.shark`, `dev.shuv.shark.widgets`, and
  `dev.shuv.shark.notification-service`; main push/Siri/App Group/Apple-auth capabilities and
  widget App Group capability are configured. Apple added its immutable default in-app-purchase
  capability, but SHark creates no products or billing surface.
- 2026-07-27: isolated exe.dev VM `shark-prod` exists in PDX with 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, and 25 GB disk.
  No application or secrets are deployed yet.
- 2026-07-27: the secret-free worktree built successfully as a Linux Docker image on `shark-prod`;
  an ephemeral loopback smoke container returned health 200, API-style root 401, browser-style root
  302, authenticated favicon 401, and removed pricing 404, then was deleted.

## Blocked release evidence

- Physical light, dark, tinted, splash, and mask appearance review: pending a development build.
- Expo project ownership, Apple App Group/Services ID associations, App Store Connect record, and
  release credentials: pending operator-authorized browser work.
- Sqim development artifact, HTTPS install page, signed entitlements, and two-iPhone acceptance:
  pending operator-owned identities and assets.
- `shark-prod` DNS/TLS, immutable running image, verified off-host snapshot, restore, no-op deploy,
  and rollback: not yet proven.
- EAS/App Store Connect build, internal TestFlight installation, release tag, and final provenance:
  not yet proven.
